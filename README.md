# ChasingDaybreak by Betsy Tuggle
This was my final project for my Media Device Architecture class. I had to make everything in this game, excluding the music, using the programming language, C.

The goal was to create a game from scratch in 1 month to then give a presentation on at the end of the semester. We got extra points if we submitted the game ahead of time,
so I raced to meet that deadline and got rewarded for it. It was an incredibly worthwhile project that gave me a lot of experience with
game design, pixel art, storytelling, working on intense deadlines, and understanding C as a programming language.
